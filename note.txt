need to change the structure type

no next and previous 

need to implement the shortest path first algorithm and start routing with the index of the struct rather than next and previous.
create successor and predecessor routing table.

keep note of the transaction by using the transaction id..ie---cbr 1 and cbr2 need to be distinguished.

find the energy lost in packet transfer, lost, dropped, received....need to change energy accordingly.

i can store the routing path in a arrray and run the array of numbers and changee the value of the struct directly. Thus no dependencies of next or previous command and i can change the value without moving linearly.

thus to reroute it is very simple. change the array(replace the node number with the node that has energy and buffer space....)
